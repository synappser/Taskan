# Taskan

**A Lightweight Task Outliner**

Too big a goal, if you can break it down into easily chewable tasks you're half-way done! A simple list is often enough to get you started.

**Taskan** is a lightweight task outliner that organizes and auto-formats your projects in tasks, notes and tags. It takes its inspiration from Hog Bay's **TaskPaper** in staying plain-text based with no vendor lock-in. You can always open files saved in Taskan in any text editor including TaskPaper.

**Taskan** is still brittle. It currently lacks its kan(ban) part and the undo stack is partially broken. So don't use it for anything serious yet!

This first beta release is mostly meant to assess the general interest before diving into a more involved fine-tuning of the idea. It's more of a proof of concept than a true beta. Consider giving it a star if you like the concept.

## Features

- Taskan extends other plain-text based outliners such as TaskPaper by focusing on usability
- It comes bundled as a handy menu bar application with an easily identifiable checkbox icon
- Clicking on the menu bar icon opens the most recent document (with the last selected project)
- When the Open Recent menu item is empty it opens a new Untitled document instead
- Otherwise, no disruption comes from untimely opening of Untitled documents

- A detailed tutorial is displayed on first launch (also available through the Help menu)
